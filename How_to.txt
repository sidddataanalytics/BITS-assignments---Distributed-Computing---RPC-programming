Steps for executing the FACTORIAL Program:
1)	Create a New Folder “factorial”
2)	Open terminal and set the path to the folder “factorial”
3)	Execute the command in terminal: rpcgen -C factorial.x
4)	The above command will create the following files:
a) factorial.h	b) factorial_clnt.c	c) factorial_svc.c	d) factorial_xdr.c  
5)	Create Client and Server Files factorial_client.c, factorial_server.c and the copy these files into “factorial” folder.
6)	In the terminal, Execute the following commands:
a)	gcc -lnsl -o client factorial_client.c factorial_clnt.c factorial_xdr.c
b)	gcc -lrpcsvc -lnsl -o server factorial_server.c factorial_svc.c factorial_xdr.c
7)	Type ./server in terminal
8)	Open a New Terminal and set the path to the folder “factorial”
9)	Type ./client localhost <no>  (Here {no: 1,2,3,4,5,6……} is the input no. to factorial program
10)	The RESULT will be displayed in Client Machine.
